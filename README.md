# home-hunt

Home Hunt is an iOS mobile application with the purpose to help its users in the process of finding their new home. The application works with a remote server on which the data is stored. Each user is required to be registered in order to use the application and benefit from its features.

The application has three main types of information which can store. These are agents, adverts and appointments.

Each agent in the system has a profile which contains his/her individual information. The stored information consists of both first and last name, phone, email, the company he/she works for, website and a rating which is based on the mobile application’s users vote.

Home hunt allows to store advertises with the following information: type (could be an apartment or a house), rating base on the mobile application’s users vote, city, address and the agent’s information which represents/sells the apartment/house. In addition, an option attributes can be stored such as quadrature, price, floor, availability for parking place, the type of the heating used, number of rooms, etc.

Besides, the application allows users to create and edit appointment for visiting a certain add. Each appointment keeps an information about the date and time, status (visited, pending, done), some notes, information about the apartment/house and the agent.
